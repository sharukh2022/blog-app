            <h2 class="headings">Automation Testing an overview</h2>
            <span class="dates">Edyoda </span><span>| 23 March 2014</span>
            <p class="descriptions">Automation is majorly used to automate repetitive tasks and other testing tasks which are unable to perform by manual testing. This testing will support both functional and non-functional testing. <br><br>

                <b>Working Process of Automation Testing:</b> <br>
                
                The initial step is to analyze the current system test coverage,
                To identify paths that would benefit from automation,
                To design plan and select test cases for automation,
                To execute the test cases and observes their performance,
                To develop an automation framework and global functions,
                Finally, review the test cases under automation,<br><br>
               <b>Advantages of Automation Testing:</b> <br>
                
                This testing increases the test execution speed.
                It helps in the maximum coverage of test cases.
                It costs less compared to manual testing.
                Automation Testing saves time and money while compared to manual testing.
                It feels challenging and interesting while performing test execution whereas manual testing feels boring.</p>
