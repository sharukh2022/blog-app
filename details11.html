            <h2 class="headings">LAMP Stack Vs MEAN Stack</h2>
            <span class="dates">Edyoda </span><span>| 23 Jul 2016</span>
            <p class="descriptions">With many organizations around the world intensely depending on programming for their everyday undertaking, the need for big business level applications, sites, and servers has become apparent. When developing an app from scratch, utilizing consistent, scalable, and standardized software is imperative. While web stacks have become a crucial part of development, they have evolved over the years, making it harder for developers to choose. LAMP and MEAN are two of the most popular development stacks. And even although they rely on different technologies for backend languages, server environment, and databases, there has been a lot of contention about which of the two is better. <br><br>
                LAMP is a set of software subsystems that are combined to perform tasks without dependencies on external software or data. It is the short form for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. LAMP works as a bunch of software programs that allow seamless and smooth integration with each other, thus becoming one of the most potent platforms for web application development. <br><br>
                MEAN can be defined as a software bundle that stands for MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and NodeJS. Working together, these software programs helps to simplify the web development process. The core strength of MEAN stack is in its centralization of JavaScript as its primary programming language. Every component in this web stack is written in JavaScript and the database stores data in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. This means that JS is not only used as a client-side scripting language but also in the entire application, which increases productivity. <br><br>
