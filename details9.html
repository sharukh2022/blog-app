            <p class="descriptions">Building cross-platform mobile apps is trending these days, with the advent of frameworks that can build native apps without using swift for iOS or Java for Android.

                React Native and Flutter are the two most popular cross-platform mobile development frameworks that are being used to build thousands of mobile apps today. If you have to pick React Native vs. Flutter which one should you pick?
                
                There is no right answer to this question. The answer to this question depends on your business needs and use-cases. Both React Native and Flutter are powerful contenders with their own set of pros and cons.
                
                Being a React Native developer myself, I have tried to write this article without bias.
                
                Both React Native and Flutter come with a lot of similarities like, building cross-platform apps using one codebase, hot reloading, excellent UI, awesome tooling and native features. But, they do have their differences.
