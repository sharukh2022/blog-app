            <p class="descriptions">DevOps is the efficient development, deployment, testing and the operation of the highest quality software possible.

                Before devops came into the limelight, our traditional olâ€™ IT had two separate teams in a organization - the Development team and the Operations team. The development team worked on the software, developing it and making sure that the code worked perfectly. After hours of hardwork and a lot of trial and error, the team releases a code which has to be executed by the Operations team which is responsible for the release and operation of the code.
                
                The operations team will be checking the application and its performance and reporting back any bugs, if present.
                
                As simple and planned out as it may sound, the two major teams always had a conflict when it came to execution.</p>
